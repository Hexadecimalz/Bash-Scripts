# #Ô∏è‚É£ Bash-Scripts 

Not much here but I hope to grow it over time. If there is an emoji by the script, then it's a script I'm particularly proud of. 

Here is a quick synopsis of each script so far: 
- **here.sh** it's a simple heredoc, nothing special
- **removesitself.sh** I found this one reading the GNU Bash documentation and just couldn't resist. You have to run it like this `./removesitself.sh`
- **sed-stars.sh** If it should be done, then make sure to do it. It's a function that prints things *x* times. 
- ‚≠ê **set-ip.sh** This one might be useful... I need to set static IPs sometimes on CentOS/RHEL/Rocky clients and this feels easier than using `nmcli` directly. 
- **tar-xyz.sh** This is a script to unzip bzip, gzip, xz, and star archives. 
- üçÄ **tinyssh** Needs a new name... It helps you create SSH aliases in `.bash_aliases` file so you don't have to remember the IP/DNS etc. when starting an SSH session. This one, I think, deserves its own repo once I find a better name, and I plan to work on some additional features as well. 
- **yaml-frontmatter.sh** I take a lot of online courses and use Zettlr to take notes. I use YAML front matter to create custom titles and add keywords to the file, but I figured it would help to automate file creation to some extent and save time creating the front matter myself.
